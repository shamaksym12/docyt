## Ruby version

We are using Ruby 2.6.3 (see .ruby-version file)

## System dependencies

Please have the following software installed in your system:

* PostgtreSQL

On Mac you can run:

    brew install postgresql

## Run Rails server

    bin/server.sh

It will listen on port 3000 (SSL only). You can open up the following URL in browser to access the server:

    https://auth.localhost.docyt.com:3000/

If browser complains about the SSL error, it is safe to ignore it and proceed. You can also install Docyt's CA file by following [this instruction](https://docytinc.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DOC/pages/774733847/Add+Docyt+CA+file+to+the+list+of+trusted+certificates)

## Report Schema

We are using [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) to define the reports. The schema file is located at
[app/assets/schemas/report-schema.json](app/assets/schemas/report-schema.json). You can also access the documentation
[here](app/assets/schemas/docs).

HTML documentaton from JSON schema. Follow the link for installation instructions. The documentation can be generated using the following command:
